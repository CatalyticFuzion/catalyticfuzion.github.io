# CatalyticFuzion Manifesto

## Vision

CatalyticFuzion was created to unify requirements, architecture, code, and testing into a single, iterative, and automatable entity.

In a world where automated coding, AI assistance, and DevOps are standard, we need more than just narrative behavior descriptions:
We need a structured, machine-readable, and architecture-compatible DSL.

CatalyticFuzion is the answer to this need.

## Purpose

- To structure requirements in a way that naturally maps to system architecture (classes and methods).
- To bind behavior descriptions directly to the underlying system structure.
- To make requirements machine-readable and AI-parsable, so coding can be automated iteratively.
- To support both testing and system design with a single, narrative-friendly, yet structured DSL.
- To unite BDD and OOP in a practical, operational language that can drive the entire software development process.

## Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| @class and @method | Define the object-oriented structure of the system (classes and methods). |
| @input and @output | Clearly define all data flows to and from methods. |
| @dependency | Explicitly indicate which external services/methods a function depends on. |
| Given/When/Then Steps | Preserve the narrative form for human readability. |
| [$structured references] | Bind narrative Steps to the system's data and functions. |
| Expectation section | Gather all output and side-effect verifications in one clear way. |
| Scenario Outline | Blueprint for a method, supported by Examples. |
| Feature Outline (future extension) | Blueprint for a class (service) with purpose, dependencies, and API overview. |

## Why CatalyticFuzion is Necessary

1. Classic Gherkin was designed for simple test descriptions – not system architecture.
2. Modern development requires requirements, code, and tests to be structurally bound together.
3. AI-based coding requires machine-readable, structural descriptions – not just narratives.
4. Systemic development (DevOps, CI/CD, AutoDoc) requires full tracing from requirements to code.

## Goals

- To describe an entire software system in CatalyticFuzion – from domain model to API to tests.
- To generate C#/F#/Dart/TypeScript classes, methods, and tests directly from requirements.
- To generate PlantUML diagrams and other visual artifacts automatically.
- To create a development cycle where requirements, architecture, and tests are a single source of truth.
- To make AI-based collaboration in coding natural, safe, and effective.

## Beyond Cucumber Gherkin

CatalyticFuzion expands on Cucumber's Gherkin by adding the crucial architecture and static typing elements that traditional Gherkin lacks. While Cucumber focuses on behavior only, CatalyticFuzion creates a complete bridge between requirements, architecture, and implementation through a human-AI collaborative approach.
