# Introduction to CatalyticFuzion

CatalyticFuzion is an innovative project aimed at creating a Human-to-AI Domain Specific Language (DSL) by building on concepts from Gherkin and object-oriented programming paradigms.

## Vision

The project originally started as "GherkinSharp," inspired by the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) paradigm, but has evolved into CatalyticFuzion as we move beyond traditional BDD constraints toward a more flexible and powerful human-AI interface.

Our goal is to create a DSL that:
- Makes it easier for humans to communicate complex concepts to AI systems
- Leverages the best of both Gherkin's readable syntax and object-oriented programming
- Acts as a catalyst for effective human-AI collaboration
